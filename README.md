The dashboard above highlights trends in average selling prices, total number of cars sold for various car brands from 1994 to 2020

Here are the key insights for each chart in the dashboard:

### 1. Number of Cars Sold by a Brand in a Particular Year
- **Key Insights**: Brands like Maruti, Hyundai, and Honda have consistently sold more cars over the years, indicating their strong presence in the market. Luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW have fewer sales but likely target a more niche, premium segment.

### 2. Average Selling Price of a Brand vs. Fuel Type
- **Key Insights**: Diesel vehicles generally have higher average selling prices across most brands, especially in premium brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Petrol vehicles also maintain a strong presence, while CNG and LPG vehicles are positioned as more economical choices.

### 3. Engine CC vs. Average Selling Price
- **Key Insights**: There is a clear trend where vehicles with higher engine capacities (CC) have higher average selling prices. This correlation suggests that vehicles with more powerful engines are positioned in the higher-end market.

### 4. Average Selling Price vs. Number of Seats and Transmission Type
- **Key Insights**: Vehicles with 4 seats have the highest average selling price, particularly in models with automatic transmissions. This suggests that smaller, luxury vehicles are in high demand. Manual transmission vehicles generally have lower average prices across all seating configurations.

### 5. Average Selling Price vs. Number of Owners
- **Key Insights**: The value of vehicles drops significantly after the first ownership. Vehicles with zero previous owners (new or nearly new) command the highest average selling price, while those with multiple previous owners see a considerable decrease in value.

### 6. Average Selling Price vs. Kilometers Driven
- **Key Insights**: Cars with fewer kilometers driven have significantly higher average selling prices, reaffirming that lower mileage is a critical factor in determining the resale value of a vehicle. The price tends to decrease as the kilometers driven increase.
